		<h2>Reflection</h2>

		<div class="marginbottom-3">
			<h4>Redirection is normal</h4>
			<p>As this was my first time conducting multiple steps of user research and working with both the organizers and participants, it was not easy  to prioritize a particular design problem to tackle. It was also frustrating when we would settle on a direction but then another problem would surface. How we ultimately solved this problem was focusing on organizer's top needs and values, as well as what participants want the most.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="marginbottom-3">
			<h4>The power of individual strengths</h4>
			<p>In previous junior design classes, everyone had similiar skills and we tend to complete all design tasks together. However, for this project, everyone had been designing for a couple of years and understood their strengths and weaknesses. When we worked together, everyone had a particular role and their strengths to create an efficient and motivational work environment.</p>
