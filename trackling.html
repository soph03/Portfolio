				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>A 2 month <strong>school project</strong> that is separated into two parts: <strong>research</strong> and <strong>design</strong>. The design process first examines a <strong>relevant problem</strong> through research then focuses on creating an easy-to-use and <strong>accessible solution</strong> that can help our users mitigate the problem.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- 
			<div class="para-item">
				<h2>Audience</h2>
				<p>Seniors who are 75 years of age or older.</p>
			</div> -->

			<div class="para-item">
				<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p>Many seniors (age 75 and above) <strong>lack physical awareness</strong> and do not understand their physical capacity to be active thus pushing themselves too hard and causing unexpected injuries or falls. </p>

			<div class="vscia-grid">
				<div><h2>Inspiration</h2></div>
				<div>
					<p>As people return to their normal activities from pre-covid times, my team and I were specifically curious about seniors and their experience re-engaging with different activities. Since many of our family and friends faced difficulty maintaining physical exercise during the pandemic, we wondered if seniors also encountered similiar struggles.</p>
					<p>This spark helped to determine our research domain: <strong> Mobility and Movement</strong></p>
				</div>
			</div>


			<div class="vscia-grid">
				<div><h2>Affinity Map</h2></div>
				
				<div>
					<h3>Goal</h3>
					<h5 class="marginbottom-2">Determine a problem area to focus on.</h5>
					<h3>Key Observations</h3>
					<p>Using our research on Mobility and Movement, we compiled all our data on<strong> Miro</strong> to observe the different topics within our domain.</p>
					<p class="marginbottom-2">Using Nielsen Norman's <strong>severity rating</strong>, our group narrowed down to two problem areas: Dependence and Physical Awarness. Ultimately we chose to focus on<strong> physical awarness</strong> because we had stronger supporting evidence from interviews and primary sources.</p>
				
					<figure>
						<a href="img/affinitymap-trackling.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/affinitymap-trackling.png" alt="Image of affinity diagram" width="900"></a>
						<p>The sticky notes are thoughts, ideas, and notes from our research and the red pentagon in the corner is the sum of our severity ratings (rectangle, star, and circle) for this topic.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>With a defined topic area, we created two<strong> 'How Might We'</strong> to guide us through further research.</p>

					<p>Two features that caught my attention was the Heart Rate Analysis and Audio Coaching. Unlike younger athletes who focus on performance based goals, seniors are different in that they priorities capability and safey.

		<h2>Design Ideas</h2>

		<div>
			<p>After observing existing applications and their features, each of our team members brainstormed two new ideas that can help solve the user's problem.</p>
			<h3>Top Ideas</h3>
			<p><strong>#1</strong> Ability to connect with existing health monitor applications</p>
			<p><strong>#2</strong> Specific health and exercise related questions post workout</p>
			<img src="img/trackling-designidea2.png" width="500">
			<p><strong>#3</strong> Logging workout via BPM (Beats per minute) with difference colours</p>
			<img src="img/trackling-designidea3.png" width="500">
			<p><strong>#4</strong> Notify users to rest when their heart rate increases pass a safe zone</p>
			<img src="img/trackling-designidea4.png" width="500">

			<h3>First Draft</h3>
			<p>With our key features in mind, we proceeded to creating our first set of designs.</p>

	<!-- User Testing -->
	<section id="usertesting-trackling">
		<div class="center-container-vscia">
		<div class = "vscia-grid">

		<h2>Design Revisions</h2>

		<div>
			<p class="para-item">From the first draft, we completed two more with minor tweaks in colour, layout and content. Once we finised our final design and working prototype, we completed<strong> two different tests to evaluate important issues</strong>.</p>

			<h3>Test #1: Heuristics Evaluation</h3>
			<p>Using Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics for user interface design <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">(https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)</a>, we discovered that the heuristic we neglected most throughout the application was <strong>helping users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.</strong></p>
			<p>An example of this issue occuring is in the <strong>Sign-up</strong> process where the user clicks on the 'next' button. Without completing all of the fields, the <strong>interface does not generate change</strong> nor does it notify the user of the error (figure 1). The inability to help users recognize errors can cause fustrations to those who do not understand the reason of why they cannot continue to the next step.</p>
			<p>A simple fix was to add a <strong>red border</strong> over unselected buttons or incomplete fields with an error message below to inform the user of the problem (figure 2).</p>

					<figcaption>figure 2</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
			</div>

			<h3>Test #2: User Testing</h3>
			<h5>Due to the absence of an iPhone 11 and the imprecise aspect ratios on an alternative mobile device, testing was conducted on laptop.</h5>

			<h4>Prominent Issues</h4>
			<p>Through our testings we learned that seniors paid more attention to <strong>content and instructions</strong> rather than the visual cues.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Unlike the other group projects I have completed in the past where each team member had a specific role or skill they excelled at, this time I look on a leadership role where I helped position the group in the right direction during the initial stages of the design process and later overlooked the whole project while focusing on my own individual tasks.</p>
				<p>If I had more time, I would also look into usability as a whole including the mobile device itself and whether the features on the application are feasible while a user is active and exercising.</p>
