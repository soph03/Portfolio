				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>A 2 month <strong>school project</strong> that is separated into two parts: <strong>research</strong> and <strong>design</strong>. The design process first examines a <strong>relevant problem</strong> through research then focuses on creating an easy-to-use and <strong>accessible solution</strong> that can help our users mitigate the problem.</p>

			<div class="para-item">
				<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p>Many seniors (age 75 and above) <strong>lack physical awareness</strong> and do not understand their physical capacity to be active thus pushing themselves too hard and causing unexpected injuries or falls. </p>

					<h4>Key Observations</h4>
					<p>Using out research on<strong> Mobility and Movement</strong> we compiled all our data on Miro to determine the top 2 problems within our topic domain.</p>
					<p class="marginbottom-2">Using Nielsen Norman's <strong>severity rating</strong>, our group narrowed down to two problem areas: Dependence and Physical Awarness. Ultimately we chose to focus on<strong> physical awarness</strong> because we had stronger supporting evidence from interviews and primary sources.</p>

		<h2>Design Revisions</h2>

		<div>
			<p class="para-item">Once we finised our final design and prototype, we completed two different tests to evaluate issues that needed to be fixed.</p>

			<h3>Heuristics Evaluation</h3>
			<p>Using Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics for user interface design <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">(https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)</a>, we discovered that the heuristic we neglected most throughout the application was <strong>helping users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.</strong></p>
			<p>An example of this issue occuring is in the <strong>Sign-up</strong> process where the user clicks on the 'next' button. Without completing all of the fields, the <strong>interface does not generate change</strong> nor does it notify the user of the error (figure 1). The inability to help users recognize errors can cause fustrations to those who do not understand the reason of why they cannot continue to the next step.</p>
			<p>A simple fix was to add a <strong>red border</strong> over unselected buttons or incomplete fields with an error message below to inform the user of the problem (figure 2).</p>

			</div>

			<h3>User Testing</h3>
			<h5>Due to the absence of an iPhone 11 and the imprecise aspect ratios on an alternative mobile device, testing was conducted on laptop.</h5>

			<h4>Prominent Issues</h4>
			<p>Although visual design is crucial in helping seniors use technology, through our testings we learned that seniors paid more attention to <strong>content and instructions</strong> rather than the visual cues.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Font size below 14</li>
				<img src="img/trackling-testing1.png" class="img-trackling-usertesting">
				<li>Low contrast colours</li>
				<img src="img/trackling-testing2.png" class="img-trackling-usertesting">
				<li>Inaccurate survey options</li>
				<img src="img/trackling-testing3.png" class="img-trackling-usertesting">
				<li>Jargon</li>
				<img src="img/trackling-testing4.png" class="img-trackling-usertesting">
			</ol>

			<h4>Others</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Progress bar</li>
				<li>Element hierarchy</li>
				<li>Radio buttons</li>
			</ul>

			<p>In our final prototype we ensured that the language and instructions were clear, yet enough to maintain a simple-to-read interface.</p>

	<!-- Solution -->
	<section id="solution-trackling">

		<div class="trackling-solution-background">
		<div class="center-container-bump">

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>Trackling fitness support app that utilizes user’s health data from in-app logged activity together with synced health applications to provide <strong>personalized workouts, notifications and visualized progress tracking</strong> . Trackling also logs users’ activity progress through performance metrics such as distance travelled, average moving pace during an activity, elevation gain on the route, and total time elapsed for an activity.</p>

			<div>
				<h3 class="h3-zerobloc">Goal</h3>
				<p><strong>Notify users when they are exceeding their physical limits</strong> based on the safe thresholds of their active heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) and age group, for low, moderate, and high intensity activities.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<h3>Design Considerations</h3>
				<p>To create an accessible application suitable for <strong>seniors</strong> , the design considerations include <strong>high contrast colour combinations, larger standard font, and formal language</strong> understood by our users.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>User Persona</h3>
				<p class="para-item">Sam, a 75 year old grandmother, has just began to exercise after staying at home for 3 months. She is excited to go on walks around the neighbourhood but is afraid of exceeding her physical capabilities and causing injuries.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Onboarding</h3>
			<img src="img/trackling-onboarding.png" class="marginbottom-2">
				<div class="trackling-solution-grid">
					<img src="img/trackling-solution1.gif" width="310">
					<div>
						<h4>Health Application Data Sync</h4>
						<p class="trackling-solution-dsc">In the onboarding, <strong>health data from other exisiting applications can be synced</strong>  with Trackling to create a more seamless and personalized health tracking experience using information, such as average resting BPM, steps taken in a day, week or month, and other performance-based statistics.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

			<div class="para-item"></div>

			<h3>Navigation Page</h3>
			<img src="img/trackling-navigation.png" class="marginbottom-2">
				<div class="trackling-solution-grid">
					<img src="img/trackling-solution2.gif" width="310">
					<div>
						<h4>Activity Routes</h4>
						<p class="trackling-solution-dsc">From suggested workouts in the home page, the user is led to the Workout page where they are given <strong> walking routes within their vicinity</strong> - according to the personal information gained through onboarding.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

			<div class="para-item"></div>

			<h3>Workout Recorder</h3>
			<img src="img/trackling-record.png" class="marginbottom-2">
				<div class="trackling-solution-grid">
					<img src="img/trackling-solution3.gif" width="310">
					<div class="trackling-solution-dsc">
						<h4>Real-Time Health Report</h4>

						<p>The most crucial feature of our application is providing users with <strong>real-time notifications</strong> during their workout depending on their 'zone'. These 'zone' associate with the user's heart rate and appear on on top of the display:</p>
						<div>
						<p><strong class="green-font">Green:</strong> heart rate under 102</p>
						<p><strong class="yellow-font">Yellow:</strong> heart rate under 128</p>
						<p><strong class="red-font">Red:</strong> heart rate above 128. </p>
						</div>
						<p>If the user enters the <strong class="yellow-font">yellow</strong> zone, the system will alert with a notification and in the <strong class="red-font">red</strong> zone, there will also be <strong>audio and haptic alerts</strong> to notify the user to take a break until their BPM goes into the safe zone again. 

						While the user is taking a break, they can visually watch their zones and heart rate change.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

			<div class="para-item"></div>

			<h3>Post Workout</h3>
			<img src="img/trackling-survey.png" class="marginbottom-2">
				<div class="trackling-solution-grid">
					<img src="img/trackling-solution4.gif" width="310">
					<div class="trackling-solution-dsc">
						<h4>Activity Survey</h4>
						<p>Once an exercise is complete, the application prompts a post workout survey to understand the user's <strong>emotions and physical state</strong>.</p>
					<div>
					<p><strong>Question #1:</strong> "How are you feeling"</p>
					<p><strong>Question #2:</strong> "How was your walk"</p>
					<p><strong>Question #3:</strong> If Q2 was...</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Effortless/ Easy -> Option of another workout</li>
						<li>Okay -> Back to home screen</li>
						<li>Hard/ Extreme -> Reason of difficulty is inquired</li>
					</ol>
					</div>
					<p>The post activity survey is an important component of our application as it allows Trackling to extract information and recommend workouts that are catered to the users physical ability and limits.</p></div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Unlike the other group projects I have completed in the past where each team member had a specific role or skill they excelled at, this time I look on a leadership role where I helped position the group in the right direction during the initial stages of the design process and later overlooked the whole project while focusing on my own individual tasks.</p>
				<p>If I had more time, I would also look into usability as a whole including the mobile device itself and whether the features on the application are feasible while a user is active and exercising.</p>
