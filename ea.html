				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>EA is one of the largest gaming companies in the world, including games such as Apex Legends, The Sims 4, and It Takes Two. During my 4 month internship, I worked on the EA App, a PC platform for players to download, update, and manage their games. As well as to connect with other players across platforms. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="para-item">
				<h2>Project</h2>
				<p>As a UX Design Intern, I discovered problems, created new game states and simplified the game tile system. Throughout the process, I worked with my Manager Dave, gaining experience presenting, building rationale, and practicing product thinking.</p>
			</div>

			<h2 class="h2-lead">TL;DR</h2>

			<div class="para-item">
				<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p>Through a design thinking workshop and looking at past user research studies, we identified three problems with the Game Tiles in the EA app.   </p>
				<p class="problem">1. Tiles are being presented at the same level of importance.</p>
				<p class="secondaryproblem">2. Cluttered discounted price label in a game tile</p> 
				<p class="secondaryproblem">2. Inconsistent Add-on tile components throughout the application</p>

			<div class="vscia-grid">

				<div><h2>EA Application</h2></div>

				<div>
					<p>The EA App is a windows application for players to download, update and manage their games. It provides the ability to connect with friends and integrate with external applications such as discord.</p>

					<p>Throughout the application, game tiles can be found displaying key information such as the image of the game, price, and membership type.</p>

			<h2 class="h2-lead">Design Process</h2>

			<div class="vscia-grid">
				<div><h2>Audit/User research</h2></div>
				<div>
					<h3>Pt 1. Problem Identification</h3>
					<p>To familiarize myself with game tiles and application, I conducted an audit to identify the different types of tiles, read through UXR(User Experience Research) reports and briefly looked at competitors application.</p>
					<img src="img/ea-imgPH.png">
					<p>The most interesting user research was understanding the user journey of a player and the archetypes' motivations.</p>
					<p>After the research, I sorted the tiles into groups(user journey, location, tile size and shape, archetype motivations) to identify potential inconsistencies and gaps.</p>
					<img src="img/ea-imgPH.png">
					
					<h3>Pt 2. Problem prioritization</h3>
					<p class="marginbottom-2">Along with my manager, the problems we identified were sorted and organized from highest impact to least effort to determine which problems to focus on.</p>
					<img src="img/ea-imgPH.png">

					<h4>Focus Areas</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>How might we present different game states?</li>
						<li>How might we place price and discounts more effectively?</li>
						<li>How might we re-imagine a consistent Add-on tile design?</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
			</div>


			<div class="vscia-grid">
				<div>
					<h2>User Research</h2>
					<h5>How might we present different game states?</h5>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>With the problem space in mind, I wanted to understand how other competitors presented different states and the copy used, as well as how tiles are differentiated between games and DLC(game add-ons).</p>
				
					<figure>
						<img class="marginbottom-2" src="img/ea-competitive-analysis.png" alt="Image of competitive analysis" width="900">
						<h4>Findings</h4>
						<p>Applications analyzed: Xbox Games, Epic Games, Battlenet, Steam and Fanatical.</p>
						<ol class="vertical-list">
							<li>Some apps have categorized pages: new, top seller, top rated, upcoming, etc</li>
							<li>States identified through badges, banners, or labels</li>
							<li>DLC identified within the image, title, secondary text, or badges</li>
						</ol>
					</figure>

					<p>Although having category defined pages can prevent clustering of components within a game tile, the EA app does not benefit from adding pages because it has limited filtering capabilities and a lower quantity of games compared to other applications.</p>

		<h2>Design Ideas</h2>

		<div>
			<h3>Design Considerations</h3>
			
			<h3>Copy Ideas</h3>
			<p>Prior to creating the visual design, we ideated on the possible states that could be included in a game tile. We looked through the user journey of a player, states used by competitor's and states that are in the process of development to determine a list of possible ideas.</p>
			<img src="img/ea-copy.png">
			<p class="para-item">After discussing with my Manager, the game states we chose to focus on were: Coming soon, Pre-orderable, New, Discount percentage (ex. -30%), and In-collection.</p>

			<h3>Interface Design</h3>
			<img src="img/ea-ex-comp.png">
			<p class="para-item">Components from the existing design system that we want to leverage. </p>

			<h3>Information Hierarchy</h3>
			<p>Although the position of the badge and the secondary text is fixed, there is some flexibility on where we want to place the tag.</p>
			<img src="img/ea-orderinfo.png">
			<p class="para-item">We decided to further explore options with the label postioned before the title. Compared to the other placements, this design is hierarchically separated from the other label and does not create any awkward visual separation when the title text wraps.</p>

			<h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
			<img src="img/ea-design-order.png">
			<p>We determined that the discount state would continue to lead in visual hierarchy because sales is the main driver of revenue. Followed by the 'New' state, we learned from user interviews and competitive analysis that this state is a key motivator for players. Lastly, we have the rest of the states incorporating a muted visual, and the 'Add-on' indicator that is differentiated slightly.</p>

		<h2>Design Revisions</h2>

			<div class="draft1">
				<h3>Draft 1/3</h3>
				<img src="img/ea-sample1.png">
				<p>*photo disclaimer...*</p>
				<p>After creating these drafts, I brought these designs to my greater design team and director for feedback. We collectively agreed that Option #2 was the design we wanted to pursue because 1) the labels stood out more and 2) the separation between the badge and label help create stronger visual hierarchy.</p>
				<p>However, one issue that we encountered is the visual noise produced by the 4 different labels within the add-on tile.</p>

				<img src="img/ea-d1-addon.png">
				<h1>How can we minimize the design of the add-on tile?</h1>

				<h2>First design change</h2>
				<p>Removing the strike through price<p>
				<img src="img/ea-dChange1.png">

				<h2>Second design change</h2>
				<p>Removing the Add-on label and differentiating Add-ons through shape - a shorter tile size.<p>

				<h2>Third design change</h2>
				<p>Replacing pre-orderable with coming soon<p>

				<h2>Fourth design change</h2>
				<p>Creating a system and hierarchy so that only one game state appears at a time<p>
