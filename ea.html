			<div class="para-item">
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>EA is one of the largest gaming companies in the world, including games such as Apex Legends, The Sims 4, and It Takes Two. During my 4 month internship, I worked on the EA App, a PC platform for players to download and manage their games, as well as connect with other players across platforms. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="para-item">
				<h2>Project</h2>
				<p>As a UX Design Intern, I discovered problems, created new game states and simplified the game tile system. Throughout the process, I worked with my Manager Dave, gaining experience presenting, building rationale, and practicing product thinking.</p>

		<!-- Problem -->
		<section class="highlight-darkgrey">
			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<!-- <p>Through a design thinking workshop and looking at past user research studies, we identified three problems with the Game Tiles in the EA app. </p> -->
			<p class="problem">1. Tiles are being presented at the same level of importance.</p>
			<p class="secondaryproblem">2. The price component of a discounted game tile is visually clustered.</p> 
			<p class="secondaryproblem">2. Add-on tiles are represented inconsistently throughout the application.</p> 
		</section> 

			<!-- <p>With the updated design of the game tiles, players are able to understand the different states of a game through labels, distinguish game tiles and add-ons through different tile sizes and view the home page comfortably through simplifying components .</p> -->

					<h2>EA Application</h2>
					<p>The EA App is a windows application for players to download, update and manage their games. It provides the ability to connect with friends and integrate with external applications such as discord.</p>

					<p>Throughout the application, game tiles can be found displaying key information such as the image of the game, price, and membership type.</p>

					<h3>Pt 1. Problem Identification</h3>
					<p>To familiarize myself with game tiles and application, I conducted an audit to identify the different types of tiles in the app and read through previous User Research reports.</p>
					<p>I then sorted the tiles into groups(user journey, location, tile size, and archetype motivations to identify potential inconsistencies and gaps.</p>

			<h2>Design Considerations</h2>

		<div class = "grid-twoColumn">

		<div>
			<h3>Copy Ideas</h3>
			<p>I looked through the user journey of a player, states used by competitor's and states that are in the process of development to determine a list of possible ideas.</p>
			<p class="para-item">After discussing with my Manager, the game states we chose to focus on were: Coming soon, Pre-orderable, New, Discount percentage (ex. -30%), and In-collection.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<img src="img/ea-copy.png">
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Information Hierarchy</h3>
			<p>Although the position of the badge and the secondary text is fixed, there is some flexibility on where we want to place the tag. Through some exploring, I wanted to have the 'New' label placed in front of the game title because it provides separation between the other labels within the tile, clear hierarchy, and does not affect the title when the text wraps.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<img src="img/ea-orderinfo.png">
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
			<p>Due to sales being the main driver of revenue, the discount state respectively lead in visual hierarchy, followed by the 'New' state, where I learned from user interviews and competitive analysis that new games is a key motivator for players. Lastly, we have the rest of the states incorporating a muted visual.</p>

			<h2>Design Revisions</h2>

		<div class = "grid-twoColumn">

			<div class="draft1">
				<h3>First Draft</h3>
				<p>A few designs were brought to the greater design team and it was agreed that this design could be pursued further because the separation between the badges and labels helped create stronger visual hierarchy.</p>
				<p>However, one issue that we encountered is the visual noise produced by the 4 different labels within the add-on tile.</p>
